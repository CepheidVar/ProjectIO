Project IO

Project IO is an open source clone of the game, "Etrian Odyssey" that was designed
and published by Atlus.

The project was started as a way for me to practice up my software development skills, 
and when the project is completed, I can pass the time between releases of the game.

If the development process goes well, the project will have full customization in art,
maze, classes, skills, items, and so on.

Code Notes

The code is a disaster. I need to move numerous sections to separate namespaces, and
put in checks for OpenGL features. The required OpenGL version 3.2 is a little high for
the needs of the project, so I have to change the OpenGL version. The whole data folder
needs to be reorganized. I will separate the various resources into their own subfolders,
and then move the data folder to its own subfolder to indicate the "base" testing game.

In short, there's a lot to do.

The project makes use of the following libraries, which must be installed:

- SDL2 2.0.1(www.libsdl.org)
