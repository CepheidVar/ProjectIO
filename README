Project IO

Project IO is an open source clone of the game "Etrian Odyssey" designed and
published by Atlus.

The project was started as a way for me to both practice up my development
skills and, when it is completed, pass the time between releases of the game.

If all goes well, the project will have full customization in regards to art,
the maze, classes, skills, items, and whatever else I can think of.

Code Notes

The code is a disaster.  There's a lot of things that need to be done, besides
basic cleanup.  I need to move numerous sections to either separate namespaces.
I need to put in checks for OpenGL features.  I even need to consider reducing
the required OpenGL version, as 3.2 is a little high for the needs of the
project.  I also need to re-organize the whole data folder, separate the
various resources into their own subfolders, and then move the data folder
to it's own subfolder to indicate the "base" testing game.

In short, there's a lot to do.
